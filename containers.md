# Introduction

We'll do this mostly as a demonstration. We encourage you to login to your account and try out the various examples yourself as we go through them.

The materials for this tutorial are available using git at the short URL ([tinyurl.com/brc-apr21](https://tinyurl.com/brc-apr21)), the  GitHub URL ([https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-containers-2021](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-containers-2021)), or simply as a [zip file](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-containers-2021/archive/main.zip).

# Outline

This training session will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to containers
   - Comparison with VMs
   - Docker and Singularity
   - Advantages of containers
- Basic usage of containers
   - Demo of running a Singularity container
   - More details on running a container
   - Use with Slurm
   - Sources of images

(need to add outline items for Wei, Oliver, Nicolas sections)

# What is a container?

 - Containerization provides "lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings".
 - Containers are similar to virtual machines in some ways, but much lighter-weight.
 - Containers are portable, shareable, and reproducible.

Terminology:

- image: a bundle of files, including the operating system, software, and possibly data and files associated with the software
   - may be stored as a single file (e.g., Singularity) or a group of files (e.g., Docker)
- container: a virtual environment based on an image (i.e., a running instance of an image)

(can we find/create a good graphic?)

## Containers versus VMs

perhaps show a figure - try to edit Wei's figure

# Why use containers?

 - Portability - install once, run 'anywhere'
 - Control your environment/software on systems (such as Savio, XSEDE) you don't own
 - Manage complex dependencies by using containers for modular computational workflows/pipelines, one workflow per container
 - Provide a reproducible environment
     - for yourself in the future
     - for others (lab members)
     - for a publication 
 - Run work that requires outdated versions of software or OS
 - Test your code on various configurations or OSes	 

# Limitations of containers

(see SDSC training)

# Docker vs. Singularity

What is Docker?

- Bring containerization to the community-scale
- Rich image repository
- Widely used by scientific communities
- Compose for defining multi-container, recipe/definition file to build docker images
- Security concerns not ideal for the HPC environment

What is Singularity?

- Open-source computer software that encapsulates an application and all its dependencies into a single image
- Bring containers and reproducibility to scientific computing and HPC
- Developed at LBL by Greg Kurtzer
- Typically users have a build system as root users, but may not be root users on a production system

How can Singularity can leverage Docker?
- Create a container based on a Docker image
- (transform a Dockerfile?)
- other?

# Examples of where containers are used

- Kubernetes runs pods based on Docker images
- MyBinder creates an executable environment by building a Docker image
- CodeOcean capsules are build on Docker images 

# Basic container use

# Running pre-existing containers using Singularity

- No root/sudo privilege is needed
- Create/download immutable squashfs images/containers
```
singularity pull --help
```
- DockerHub: Pull a container from DockerHub.
```
$ singularity pull docker://ubuntu:18.04 
$ singularity pull docker://rocker/r-base:latest
$ singularity pull docker://postgres
$ ls -lrt | tail -n 10   # careful of your quota!
$ ls -l ~/.singularity
```

```
singularity run ubuntu_18.04.sif       # use downloaded image file
## alternatively, use ~/.singularity/cache
singularity run docker://ubuntu:18.04  
```

Note the change in prompt.

```
cat /etc/issue   # not the Savio OS!
which python     # not much here!
pwd
echo "written from the container" > junk.txt
ls /global/scratch/paciorek | head -n 5
exit
cat junk.txt
```

```
singularity run docker://rocker/r-base    # easy!
singularity run docker://postgres         # sometimes things are complicated!
```

# Other ways of running a container

- Singularity Hub: If no tag is specified, the master branch of the repository is used

```
$ singularity pull hello-world.sif shub://singularityhub/hello-world
$ singularity run hello-world.sif
```

Here's how one runs a Docker container (on a system where you have admin access):

```
echo $HOME
docker run -it --rm rocker/r-base bash
pwd
ls /accounts/gen/vis/paciorek    # no automatic mount of my host home directory
```


# Different ways of using a Singularity container

- **shell** sub-command: invokes an interactive shell within a container
```
singularity shell hello-world.sif
```
- **run** sub-command: executes the containerâ€™s runscript
```
singularity run hello-world.sif
```
- **exec** sub-command: execute an arbitrary command within container
```
singularity exec hello-world.sif cat /etc/os-release
```

`singularity inspect -r hello-world.sif`

# Container processes on the host system

Let's see how the container processes show up from the perspective of the host OS.

We'll run some intensive linear algebra in R.

```
singularity run docker://rocker/r-base:latest
```

```r
a <- matrix(rnorm(10000^2), 10000)
system.time(chol(crossprod(a)))
```

We see in `top` that the R process in the container shows up as an R process on the host.

# Accessing the Savio filesystems and bind paths

- Singularity allow mapping directories on host to directories within container
- Easy data access within containers
- System-defined bind paths on Savio
        - /global/home/users/
        - /global/scratch/
- User can define own bind paths: 
- e.g.: mount  /host/path/ on the host to /container/path inside the container via `-B /host/path/:/container/path`, e.g.,

```
ls /global/scratch/paciorek/wikistats_small
singularity shell -B /global/scratch/paciorek/wikistats_small:/data hello-world.sif
ls /data
touch /data/erase-me
exit
ls -l /global/scratch/paciorek/wikistats_small
```

In general one would do I/O to data on the host system rather than writing into the container.

It is possible to create writeable containers. 

# Running containers on Savio via Slurm

You can run Singularity within an `sbatch` or `srun` session.

Here's a basic job script.

```
#!/bin/bash 
#SBATCH --job-name=container-test		 
#SBATCH --partition=savio2		 
#SBATCH --account=co_stat		 			
#SBATCH --time=5:00		

singularity exec hello-world.sif cat /etc/os-release
```

# Sources of container images

- DockerHub
- SingularityHub

# Singularity workflow (leading into Nicolas' material)

- [install Singularity locally](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10XAtH9yj5uyiHr3eGHTk9h82bZXEp0aixMCmgYJhGNQ/edit?usp=sharing) (or build an image in the cloud) 
- transfer image to Savio
- run container on Savio

# Nicolas' content

# Approaches to Building
- Build a Docker image and convert
  - Convenient if you already have a Docker build file
- Build from Singularity definition file
  - Bootstrap from another Singularity container or non-Docker base OS
  - Alows extra customization with directives

# Building a Docker container
```docker
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN mkdir -p /app
```

- TODO: cover ENTRYPOINT and CMD

# Pushing to Docker Registry
TODO

# Converting Docker to Singularity
- `singularity run docker://...`
- `singularity build test.simg docker://`

Reference: https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-singularity-template/blob/master/build_examples.md

# Singularity Definition File
1. **Header**: Base to build the container off of, such as an existing Docker/Singularity/OS image
2. **Sections**: Denoted by a `%` which are executed once the container is built to configure it

Reference: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/definition_files.html

# Singularity Build Example
- TODO: add example simg file

Reference: https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-singularity-template

# Singularity Build Options
- Install Singularity locally
- Install Docker locally and use singularity-docker
  - https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-docker
- Build an image on a cloud service or continuous integration host
