Materials for Savio containers training for April 21, 2021. 

The main document is `containers.html` (or `containers_slides.html` if you prefer a version that appears in slide-show format rather than as one long HTML page).

To directly view the HTML, please [click here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-containers-2021/blob/master/containers_slides.html).

If you're not familiar with Git or Github you can download the materials as a [zip file](https://github.com/ucb-rit/savio-training-containers-2021/archive/master.zip)
